    S: The ClassA is just a fake Class.
    D: This is the description of the ClassA. By contrast to the summary, which is
    D: usually short (typically a one or very few sentences), the description can be a
    D: longer piece of text. By contrast to "rich notes" that are supported by Modelio,
    D: "standard" notes can only contains text with no formatting.
